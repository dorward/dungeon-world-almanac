# Dungeon World Almanac

A style sheet and XML format for creating nice looking almanacs for fantasy
world building in the general style of Lampblack and Brimstone's almanac
format.

**Currently very pre-alpha**

## Build instructions

Run `build.sh` from the command line. 

If you aren't on OS X then you'll probably want to edit it to remove the `open world.pdf` command and either open the PDF file manually or replace the command with something your system supports.

## Dependencies

* [Prince](http://www.princexml.com/) to convert the XML and CSS to PDF (the demo version works fine if you can live with the watermark)
* [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) to convert the SASS to CSS
